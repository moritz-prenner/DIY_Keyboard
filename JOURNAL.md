## 10/4/2025 - I created the layout i am going to use.

I want to use a ISO - Layout (German) and I want one number row and one Shortcut row. Also a volume knob is important for me. I also decided on some shortcut keys on the right hand side which i am going to bind on discord mute and some other useful functions.  

## 10/5/2025 - New Layout and schematic

I rearranged the layout and made the schematic. I settled on the rp2040 based RP2040 Pro Micro 16MB/128Mbit USB-C Controller from Keeb.io. I am going to use 84 switches (12 rows, 7 columns). And I am going to implement a rotary encoder (PEC11R-4215F-S0024). And I am probaply going to include a acrylic glass window in the case which I am going to start working on next.  

## 10/12/2025 - I updated the schematic.

I used labels. I used a new symbol for the microcontroller. I updated the matrix. I assigned footprints and decided on diodes I am going to use. I am going to use smd diodes. Hopefully blueprint will add helping hands or some sort of smd soldering accesories to the toobag.
  

## 10/26/2025 - Routed the PCB  

I updated the schematic to make wiring easier. Then I layed out all of the components and added an OLED screen. Then I routed everything and exported some pictures.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTY4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ecfa60a9d6af1740fd8a747e8bd1d7f3d2dff957/image.png)
